Task
====

Create a todo list management application using django where the user can:
 - register and log in
 - have own todo list displayed
 - manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries)
 - assign priorities to the entries.
 - do the same using a very simple REST api.

No need in any design/UI/logo, etc plain html is fine.
